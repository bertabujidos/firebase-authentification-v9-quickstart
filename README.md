# Everything you need to start using Firebase Authentification V9

This project was inspired by Web Dev Simplified on Youtube which made a tutorial about Firebase V8. So I update it for Firebase V9 and I add some cool features like auto-redirect when user is logged in and he try to access login page.

## How to use

The only thing you have to do is create a .env.local file with your Firebase credentials in your project directory.
